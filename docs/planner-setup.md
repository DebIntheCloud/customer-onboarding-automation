# Planner Setup (Teams)

**Team:** Automation Demo  
**Plan:** Onboarding Plan

Create these buckets (names must match exactly):
- 🟢 New Signup
- 🟡 In Progress
- 🔴 Escalations
- ✅ Completed

> Emojis are fine; the **flow selects buckets by display name** in the UI. If your tenant requires IDs, open Planner on the web and copy the bucket GUIDs—then map them in the “Create a task” action’s Bucket field.
